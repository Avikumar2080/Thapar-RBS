# 🏛️ Thapar Room Booking System (RBS)

### 🎓 A Secure & Scalable Room Reservation Platform for Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology

</div>

---

## 📘 Overview

The **Thapar Room Booking System (RBS)** is a full-stack platform built to simplify and digitize the process of booking lecture halls and classrooms across Thapar University.

Traditionally, room scheduling required physical registers and manual approval from administrative staff — leading to delays, double-bookings, and lack of transparency.

RBS transforms that workflow with a **real-time, intelligent, and role-based web system** accessible to all authorized Thapar faculty and departments.

> 🏫 **Hosted at:** [`rbs.thapar.edu`](https://rbs.thapar.edu)  
> 🔒 **Access:** Restricted to Thapar University's secure Wi-Fi network for privacy and data protection.  
> 👩‍🏫 **Used by:** All teaching & administrative departments.
